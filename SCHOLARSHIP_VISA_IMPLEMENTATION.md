# Scholarship & Visa Support Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the Scholarship and Visa Support features in the Physical Academy project.

## Backend Implementation

### Models

The following models were implemented in `student_clubs/models_scholarship_visa.py`:

1. **ScholarshipProgram**

   - Multilingual fields for name, description, and eligibility criteria
   - Amount, currency, and application deadline
   - Contact information
   - Active/inactive status

2. **ScholarshipRequiredDocument**

   - Foreign key to ScholarshipProgram
   - Multilingual fields for name and description
   - Required status and display order

3. **VisaSupportService**

   - Multilingual fields for title and description
   - Featured status, icon, and display order
   - Active/inactive status

4. **VisaSupportContact**
   - Multilingual fields for full name, position, office location, and hours
   - Contact information (email, phone)
   - Photo and display order

### Serializers

Serializers implemented in `student_clubs/serializers_scholarship_visa.py`:

1. API-specific serializers for each model
2. Comprehensive page data serializers:
   - `ScholarshipPageDataSerializer`: Provides all scholarship data and statistics
   - `VisaSupportPageDataSerializer`: Provides services, contacts, and featured services

### Views

ViewSets implemented in `student_clubs/views_scholarship_visa.py`:

1. ReadOnlyModelViewSets for individual models
2. Special ViewSets for page data:
   - `ScholarshipPageDataViewSet`
   - `VisaSupportPageDataViewSet`
3. Features:
   - Language parameter support
   - Response caching (15 minutes)
   - Proper error handling

### URL Configuration

URLs were added to `student_clubs/urls.py`:

1. Scholarship endpoints:

   - `/api/student-clubs/scholarship/programs/`
   - `/api/student-clubs/scholarship/documents/`
   - `/api/student-clubs/scholarship/page_data/`

2. Visa Support endpoints:
   - `/api/student-clubs/visa-support/services/`
   - `/api/student-clubs/visa-support/contacts/`
   - `/api/student-clubs/visa-support/page_data/`

### Admin Interface

Admin configurations in `student_clubs/admin_scholarship_visa.py`:

1. Rich admin interfaces with fieldsets for better organization
2. Inline editing for related models (ScholarshipRequiredDocument)
3. List displays with useful filters and search capabilities

## Frontend Integration

### API Service

Updated `services/api.js` with methods for:

1. Scholarship API:

   - `getScholarshipPageData`
   - `getScholarshipPrograms`
   - `getScholarshipDocuments`

2. Visa Support API:
   - `getVisaSupportPageData`
   - `getVisaSupportServices`
   - `getVisaSupportContacts`

### Components

Updated components to use API data with fallback to translations:

1. `Scholarship.jsx`:

   - Fetches data from API using `getScholarshipPageData`
   - Handles loading and error states
   - Falls back to translation files if API fails

2. `VisaSupport.jsx`:
   - Fetches data from API using `getVisaSupportPageData`
   - Handles loading and error states
   - Falls back to translation files if API fails

## Additional Documentation

API documentation is available in `student_clubs/scholarshipAPI.md` with:

1. Endpoint descriptions
2. Request parameters
3. Response examples
4. Integration guidance

## Next Steps

1. Run migrations to create the database tables
2. Add initial data through the admin interface
3. Test API endpoints
4. Verify frontend integration

## Implementation Notes

- Multilingual support includes Russian (ru), English (en), and Kyrgyz (kg)
- Error handling implemented throughout the codebase
- API responses are cached to improve performance
