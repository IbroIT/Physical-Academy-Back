## Frontend Integration

The frontend component `ExchangePrograms.jsx` expects the following data structure:

1. Page title and subtitle
2. Statistics to display in the top section
3. A list of programs with details like university name, country, duration, requirements, etc.
4. Filter options for regions and duration types
5. Upcoming deadlines

The primary endpoint `/exchange-page/` provides all this data in a single API call, formatted to match the component's expected structure.
