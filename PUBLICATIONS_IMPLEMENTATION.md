# Scientific Publications Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented:

### 1. Backend - Django REST Framework API

#### Models (`science/models.py`):

- **Publication Model** with multilingual support (RU, EN, KG):

  - `title_*` - Publication title in 3 languages
  - `author_*` - Author name in 3 languages (renamed from authors\_\*)
  - `abstract_*` - Abstract/description in 3 languages
  - `journal` - Journal/conference name
  - `year` - Publication year
  - `publication_date` - Specific publication date (NEW)
  - `citation_count` - Number of citations
  - `impact_factor` - Journal impact factor
  - `doi` - Digital Object Identifier
  - `url` - External URL
  - `pdf_file` - PDF file upload
  - `image` - Publication cover image (NEW)
  - `publication_type` - Type (article, conference, book, patent)
  - `is_featured` - Featured publication flag
  - `order` - Display order

- **PublicationStats Model** - For statistics display

#### Admin Panel (`science/admin.py`):

- Full admin interface for Publications with:
  - Organized fieldsets by language (Russian, English, Kyrgyz)
  - Search functionality across all language fields
  - List display with filters
  - Editable featured and order fields

#### API Serializers (`science/serializers.py`):

- **PublicationSerializer** with:
  - Language-aware field resolution
  - PDF and image URL generation
  - Support for multilingual content based on `lang` parameter

#### API Views (`science/views.py`):

- **PublicationsViewSet** - Full CRUD operations
- **PublicationsPageView** - Complete page data (stats + featured + regular publications)
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Language parameter support

#### API Endpoints:

- `GET /api/science/publications/` - List all publications
- `GET /api/science/publications/{id}/` - Get single publication
- `POST /api/science/publications/` - Create publication
- `PUT /api/science/publications/{id}/` - Update publication
- `DELETE /api/science/publications/{id}/` - Delete publication
- `GET /api/science/publications-page/` - Get complete page data

### 2. Frontend - React Component

#### Updated ScientificPublications.jsx:

- Fetches data from real API endpoints
- Supports language switching (RU, EN, KG)
- Updated to use new field names (`author` instead of `authors`)
- Image display support for publication covers
- PDF download functionality
- Citation generation and copying
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Responsive design with animations

#### Key Features:

- **Language Support**: Automatically switches content based on i18n language
- **Image Display**: Shows publication cover images when available
- **PDF Downloads**: Direct download links for PDF files
- **Citation Handling**: Generates and copies formatted citations
- **Search & Filter**: Filter by year, search by title/author/abstract
- **Modal View**: Detailed publication view in popup

## What You Need to Do:

### 1. Database Migration

The models have been updated but the database still has old field names. You need to:

```bash
# Create and run migrations for the field changes:
python manage.py makemigrations science --name update_publication_fields
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Test Data Creation

After migration, you can create sample data:

```bash
# Run the sample data creation command:
python manage.py create_sample_publications
```

### 3. Media Files Setup

Make sure your Django settings handle media files properly:

```python
# In settings.py, ensure you have:
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'

# In urls.py (for development):
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

## API Usage Examples:

### Get All Publications (English):

```
GET /api/science/publications-page/?lang=en
```

### Create New Publication:

```
POST /api/science/publications/
{
  "title_ru": "Название статьи",
  "title_en": "Article Title",
  "author_ru": "Автор",
  "author_en": "Author",
  "journal": "Journal Name",
  "year": 2024,
  "publication_type": "article"
}
```

### Search Publications:

```
GET /api/science/publications/?search=machine learning&lang=en
```

## Frontend Integration:

The React component automatically:

- Fetches data from the API based on current language
- Displays publications with proper formatting
- Handles image and PDF file display
- Provides search and filtering functionality

## Admin Panel Usage:

1. Access Django admin at `/admin/`
2. Go to "Science" → "Publications"
3. Add new publications with content in all 3 languages
4. Upload PDF files and cover images
5. Set featured publications and display order

The implementation provides a complete, multilingual scientific publications management system with both API and admin interfaces!
